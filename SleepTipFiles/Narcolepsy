The exact cause of narcolepsy is not known. People with type 1 narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin (hi-poe-KREE-tin), also called orexin. Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain that helps control being awake and entering REM sleep.

Hypocretin levels are low in people who have cataplexy. Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known. But experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system destroys its own cells.

It's also likely that genetics plays a role in narcolepsy. But the risk of a parent passing this sleep condition to a child is very low â€” only about 1% to 2%.

Narcolepsy may be linked to exposure to the H1N1 flu, sometimes called the swine flu. It also may be linked to a certain type of the H1N1 vaccine that was given in Europe.
