*Treatment
There is no cure for narcolepsy, but treatment to help manage the symptoms include medicines and lifestyle changes.

*Medicines
Medicines for narcolepsy include:

- Stimulants. Medicines that stimulate the central nervous system are the main treatment to help people with narcolepsy stay awake during the day. Your healthcare professional may recommend modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil). These medicines aren't as habit-forming as older stimulants. They also don't produce the highs and lows related to older stimulants. Side effects are not common but may include headache, nausea or anxiety.

Solriamfetol (Sunosi) and pitolisant (Wakix) are newer stimulants used for narcolepsy. Pitolisant also may be helpful for cataplexy.

Some people need treatment with methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others). Or they may take amphetamines (Adderall XR 10, Desoxyn, others). These medicines are effective but can be habit-forming. They may cause side effects such as nervousness and a fast heartbeat.

- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medicines suppress REM sleep. Healthcare professionals prescribe these medicines to help ease the symptoms of cataplexy, hallucinations and sleep paralysis.

They include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), fluoxetine (Prozac), duloxetine (Cymbalta, Drizalma Sprinkle) and sertraline (Zoloft). Side effects can include weight gain, insomnia and digestive problems.

- Tricyclic antidepressants. These older antidepressants can treat cataplexy. But they can cause side effects such as dry mouth and lightheadedness. These medicines include protriptyline, imipramine and clomipramine (Anafranil).

- Sodium oxybate (Xyrem, Lumryz) and oxybate salts (Xywav). These medicines work well at relieving cataplexy. They help improve nighttime sleep, which is often poor in narcolepsy. They also may help control daytime sleepiness.

Xywav is a newer formulation with less sodium.

These medicines can have side effects, such as nausea, bed-wetting and sleepwalking. Taking them together with other sleeping tablets, narcotic pain relievers or alcohol can lead to trouble breathing, coma and death.

If you take medicines for other health conditions, ask your healthcare professional how they may interact with narcolepsy medicines.

Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can cause drowsiness. They include allergy and cold medicines. If you have narcolepsy, your healthcare professional may recommend that you don't take these medicines.

Researchers are studying other potential treatments for narcolepsy. Medicines being studied include those that target the hypocretin chemical system. Researchers also are studying immunotherapy. Further research is needed before these medicines become available.
