*Treatment
Symptoms of restless legs syndrome sometimes go away after treating an underlying condition, such as iron deficiency. Correcting an iron deficiency may involve taking an iron supplement by mouth. Or you may be given an iron supplement through a vein in your arm. Take iron supplements only with medical supervision and after having your blood-iron level checked.

Electrical stimulation of a nerve on the side of your knee may help RLS symptoms. Devices for electrical stimulation require a prescription from a healthcare professional.

If you have RLS without an associated condition, treatment focuses on lifestyle changes. If those aren't effective, your healthcare professional may prescribe medicines.

*Medications
Several prescription medicines are available to reduce the restlessness in the legs. Many of the medicines were developed to treat other diseases, but they may help with RLS. They include:

- Medicines affecting calcium channels. Medicines such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil and pregabalin are the first line of treatment for most people with RLS. These medicines can cause side effects such as dizziness, unsteadiness, mental fog and weight gain.

- Medicines that increase dopamine in the brain. These medicines affect levels of the chemical messenger dopamine in the brain. Rotigotine, pramipexole and ropinirole work at first. But in many people taking these medicines, RLS gets worse over time. The medicines may cause symptoms to return earlier in the day. Some people taking these medicines find that symptoms spread to the arms. This is called augmentation. The medicines also can make it hard to manage impulses, such as compulsive gambling. Because of these risks, dopamine drugs are only used if medicines affecting calcium channels don't work or cause side effects.

People who have occasional RLS symptoms may be prescribed carbidopa-levodopa (Duopa, Rytary, others) to take as needed. But healthcare professionals don't recommend taking this medicine daily or near daily. Daily use of this medicine can cause augmentation.

- Opioids. These medicines are used in low doses to treat RLS when other medicines haven't worked or have caused side effects. Most people taking opioids don't have major side effects, and these medicines are effective in managing RLS symptoms. In low doses, addiction is very rare. Some examples of opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone and buprenorphine.
It may take several trials to find the right medicine or combination of medicines that work best for you.

And some medicines for other conditions may worsen symptoms of RLS. These include some antidepressants, some antipsychotic medicines, some antinausea medicines, and some cold and allergy medicines. Your healthcare professional may recommend that you don't take these medicines, if possible. However, if you need to take them, talk about treatments to help manage RLS.

Most medicines prescribed to treat RLS aren't recommended during pregnancy. Instead, self-care techniques and iron supplements may be recommended to relieve symptoms. But if symptoms are bothersome during your last trimester, your healthcare professional may recommend the use of certain medicines.
