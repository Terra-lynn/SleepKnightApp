Around 2020, a poll showed that about 14.5% of adults experienced problems with falling asleep. This issue is often attributed to many factors such as poor sleeping habits, or any number of underlying issues. These can range from abnormal sleep schedules, insomnia, or even sleep apnea. Due to this, many of the side effects of not getting enough sleep are sleep deprivation, constant daytime fatigue, mood swings, and even mental health issues.  

We can address these issues by being able to give information to the user about their sleeping habits. A specific way to improve someoneâ€™s sleep and our goal with our proposed app, Sleep Knight, is to allow the user to manually input their hours in which they slept alongside the ability to provide notes for any given hour slept, allowing for added context. The reason we track sleep, is that a method for solving sleep issues is having a consistent and healthy sleep habit dependent on how much the user sleeps, allowing for less issues the user suffers from the side effects of sleep deprivation, allowing the user to focus on their productivity.
